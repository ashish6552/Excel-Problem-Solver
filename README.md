# Excel-Problem-Solving

In this repository I have 2 files.<br>


`Problem Solving With Excel` contains six different problem in pdf format.<br>To view the problem I suggest downloading the file and opening it locally as there are some problems in viewing pdf on git.<br>


`problem-solution.xlsx` is an excel file which contains my solutions to the problem.<br>To view it please download the file and open it locally as git doesnot support such file type.<br>Solution to each problem has been done in a separate sheets in the same same xlsx file and are in same sequence as the problems.
